A full stack project done in a team with a 1 week deadline.
**Worthy:**
The third project on the course, we worked in a team and the assignment was to create a full stack website in 1 week. We pondered on a few ideas but we eventually decided to go with the idea of comparing Forbes 100 billionaires with each other and also comparing it to miscellaneous items which also are some of the most expensive items in the world.

**Brief:**
1. Build a full-stack application - by making your own backend and your own frontend
2. Consume your API with a separate frontend built with React.
3. Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut.
4.Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible.

**Built With:**
Frontend:
1. React
2. JSX
3. SCSS
4. Axios
5. Bootstrap

Backend:
1. Mongoose
2. MongoDB
3. Express
4. Node.js
5. Insomnia

DevTools:
1. Git
2. GitHub
3. VScode

**Deployment:**
This app is deployed on .... and can be found here.

**Process:**

This one week project was one that we were all quite excited about. We were able to quickly come up with ideas that we wanted to execute and with the must haves our site must contain. Below is an image of the relationships models that we knew was important to establish on our website. I assisted Matthew on building up our Database by adding miscellaneous items and also curating a list of our richest Celebrities.

Below is also the relationship that we have established once the user is logged in they will have their own profile where they declare their savings, uploading an image of themselves and lastly they will have their own basket which will allow them to also purchase items on the site.

With this project being a Full Stack project we delegated tasks with who felt more confident with certain aspects of the site, which I started  creating the login and register page. During the project we were in constant communication with one another on Zoom, we created our own Slack chat so we could send each other code (& memeâ€™s) which kept our spirits up throughout the project, scheduled daily team stand up sessions each morning so we could discuss any challenges, talk about wins, and plan the day ahead.


**Wins & Key Learnings:**
1. Coding in a team of three people
2. Delegating tasks and communicating throughout the process of what has been completed.
3. The first project in which I worked on different branches and resolved merge conflicts using Git. Continuing on from the communication, it meant we often merged our work at the same time, as we were new to this it allowed us to help each other with troubleshooting
4. This project was invaluable as I was able to make clear understanding of why we use functions for example and understanding that multiple things can also be stored in them, which was mind-blowing whilst learning this.

**Future improvements:**
1. The website is far from finished which I am looking to revisit and styling the page better and making sure it is user friendly.
2. I would like to look into MongoDB further and make the user be able to do more once they are logged in.
